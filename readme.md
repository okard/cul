--------------------------
* KISS - Keep it small and simple
* Lightweight
* Loose coupling - so classes can be easily copied out of library and work anyway

* Documentation - Try to provide well documented code


Available functionality:
-----------------------------------

* Reference Counted Shared Pointer
* Strings
* Simple Typedefs
* Logging
* Threads

Planned features:
------------------------------------
* UTF Support
* IO (file handling, directory iteration, ...)
